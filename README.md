# PiRates.Stress

Project name: Stress level in students
Develop an artifact to predict stress levels on higher education students using Machine Learning.

This project aims to be used to help and improve educational institutions. With the results and findings of this research, colleges and universities can be favored and guided into developing changes in the design of the academic curriculum, planning of assignment submissions deadlines, final exam dates organization, and many other factors that can affect mental health in students.

The use of CRISP-DM methodology on this project made possible to achieve the main goal
proposed at the start. The predictions of stress levels in students enrolled in a higher
education course have been predicted accurately by five different Machine Learning
Models.

The results and findings of this research point out the need of providing students with
alternative tools and solutions for managing academic stress. The prediction of stress levels
can help universities and colleges to identify and carry-out measures to a problem that has
increased dramatically over time.

The findings of the prediction also aim to reduce withdrawal from institutions due to academic
stress. It is important to help students to stay motivated and keep working on their course,
without putting to waste the progress already obtained.

The end result may allow universities and colleges to identify student profiles that are at risk
and serve as a starting point to the reduction of academic stress within the institution.
